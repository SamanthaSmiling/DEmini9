## Explore the matrix of NBA players 


## Dataset
The Best NBA Players, According To RAPTOR
Ratings, updated daily, use play-by-play and player-tracking data to calculate each playerâ€™s individual plus-minus measurements and wins above replacement, which accounts for playing time

## Techniques Applied
Pandas, test by nbval, show up the outcome by Jupyter.

- Brief the project, Data source, main purpose

```Techniques required
- ./
    - Jupyter Notebook with: 
        - Cells that perform descriptive statistics using Polars or Panda.
        - Tested by using nbval plugin for pytest
    - Makefile with the following:
        - Run all tests (must test notebook and script and lib)
        - Formats code with Python blackLinks to an external site.
        - Lints code with RuffLinks to an external site.
        - Installs code via:  pip install -r requirements.txt
    - test_script.py to test script
    - test_lib.py to test library
    - Pinned requirements.txt
    - Gitlab Actions performs all four Makefile commands with badges for each one in the README.md
```
